I recently received my doctorate from TU Darmstadt under the supervision of [Prof. Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters).
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems lab (IAS)](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) and the [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/).
Previously, I interned as a researcher in [Nvidia's Seattle Robotics Lab (SRL)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/).
I did my Master's degree at UPC and my Master's Thesis at EPFL in the Biorobotics Lab.
For my research, I was honoured to be selected as an R:SS Pioneer.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **robotics and machine learning**. In particular I explore the combination of fields such as **deep generative models, motion planning and control, imitation learning, optimisation, and reinforcement learning.**
During my PhD, I adapted diffusion models to the Lie group SE(3) to represent 6-DoF grasp pose distributions, explored the composability of energy-based models for reactive motion generation and exploited normalizing flows to learn nonlinear globally stable dynamical systems from demonstrations.

If you are interested in similar topics, I am always looking for collaborations or thesis supervision, so please do not hesitate to contact me.
