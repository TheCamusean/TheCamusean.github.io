Hello
<!-- I recently received my doctorate at TU Darmstadt under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Jan Peters.</a>
I am currently a postdoc researcher part of the <a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/" target='blank'>Intelligent Autonomous Systems lab (IAS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DFKI</a>.
Previously, I interned as a researcher in <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/" target='blank'>Nvidia's Seattle Robotics Lab (SRL)</a>.
I did my Master studies at UPC with a Master Thesis at EPFL within the Biorobotics lab.
For my research, I was honored to be selected as an R:SS Pioneer.

My research interests lie in the interplay of <strong>robotics and machine learning</strong>. In particular I explore the combination of fields such as <strong> deep generative models, motion planning and control, imitation learning, optimization, and reinforcement learning.</strong>
During my doctoral studies, I adapted Diffusion Models to the Lie Group SE(3) to represent 6-DoF grasp pose distributions, explored the composability of Energy-Based Models for reactive motion generation and exploited Normalizing Flows to learn nonlinear globally stable dynamic systems from demonstrations.


In case you are interested in similar topics, I am always looking for collaborations or thesis supervisions so do not hesitate in contacting me.
