I recently received my doctorate at TU Darmstadt under the supervision of [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters).
I am currently a postdoc researcher part of the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems lab (IAS)](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) and the [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/).
Previously, I interned as a researcher in [Nvidia's Seattle Robotics Lab (SRL)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/).
I did my Master studies at UPC with a Master Thesis at EPFL within the Biorobotics lab.
For my research, I was honored to be selected as an R:SS Pioneer.

My research interests lie in the interplay of **robotics and machine learning**. In particular I explore the combination of fields such as **deep generative models, motion planning and control, imitation learning, optimization, and reinforcement learning.**
During my doctoral studies, I adapted Diffusion Models to the Lie Group SE(3) to represent 6-DoF grasp pose distributions, explored the composability of Energy-Based Models for reactive motion generation and exploited Normalizing Flows to learn nonlinear globally stable dynamic systems from demonstrations.


In case you are interested in similar topics, I am always looking for collaborations or thesis supervisions so do not hesitate in contacting me.
